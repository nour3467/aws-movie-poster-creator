## üé¨ Movie Poster Design - Broad Implementation Steps

This section outlines the implementation steps for the "Movie Poster Design" feature, which uses AWS services to generate and serve custom movie posters based on user prompts.

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

- **Bucket Name**: `movieposterdesign01`
- **Purpose**: This bucket will store the generated movie posters.

### Step 2: Create an AWS Lambda Function

- **Function Name**: `moviePosterDesignFunction`
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **Connect to AWS Bedrock**: Utilize the Stability Diffusion Model to generate an image based on the user-provided prompt.
  2. **Store the Image**: Save the generated image as an object in the S3 bucket.
  3. **Generate a Pre-Signed URL**: Create a pre-signed URL for the generated image to ensure secure, temporary access.
  4. **Send the URL**: Respond to requests via AWS API Gateway with the pre-signed URL of the generated image.

### Step 3: Create a REST API using AWS API Gateway

- **API Name**: `moviePosterDesignAPI`
- **Functionality**: Allow users to submit a prompt and return a pre-signed URL to view the generated image.
- **How it works**:
  1. **Receive Prompt**: Users pass the image generation prompt through the API.
  2. **Return Image URL**: Users receive a pre-signed URL to access the image securely.

### Step 4: Test Using Postman API Tool

- **Testing**: Use Postman to send requests to the `moviePosterDesignAPI` and ensure the entire flow from prompt submission to image retrieval via the pre-signed URL functions correctly.

These steps provide a comprehensive roadmap for setting up the movie poster generation feature, leveraging powerful AWS services to automate and secure the process.
